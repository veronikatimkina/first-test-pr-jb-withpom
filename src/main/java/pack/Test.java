        /*After initializing a pull request, you'll see a review page that shows a high-level overview of the changes
        between your branch (the compare branch) and the repository's base branch. You can add a summary of the proposed
        changes, review the changes made by commits, add labels, milestones, and assignees, and @mention individual
        contributors or teams. For more information, see "Creating a pull request."
        Once you've created a pull request, you can push commits from your topic branch to add them to your existing
        pull request. These commits will appear in chronological order within your pull request and the changes will be
        visible in the "Files changed" tab.
        Other contributors can review your proposed changes, add review comments, contribute to the pull request
        discussion, and even add commits to the pull request.
        You can see information about the branch's current deployment status and past deployment activity on the
        "Conversation" tab. For more information, see "Viewing deployment activity for a repository."
        After you're happy with the proposed changes, you can merge the pull request. If you're working in a shared
        repository model, you create a pull request and you, or someone else, will merge your changes from your feature
        branch into the base branch you specify in your pull request. For more information, see "Merging a pull request."
        If status checks are required for a repository, the required status checks must pass before you can merge your
        branch into the protected branch. For more information, see "About required status checks."
        You can link a pull request to an issue to show that a fix is in progress and to automatically close the issue
        when someone merges the pull request. For more information, see "Linking a pull request to an issue."
        You can visit your dashboard to quickly find links to recently updated pull requests you're working on or
        subscribed to. For more information, see "About your personal dashboard."
        Draft pull requests
        Draft pull requests are available in public repositories with GitHub Free and GitHub Free for organizations,
        GitHub Pro, and legacy per-repository billing plans, and in public and private repositories with GitHub Team
        and GitHub Enterprise Cloud. For more information, see "GitHub's products."
        When you create a pull request, you can choose to create a pull request that is ready for review or a draft pull
        request. Draft pull requests cannot be merged, and code owners are not automatically requested to review draft
        pull requests. For more information about creating a draft pull request, see "Creating a pull request" and
        "Creating a pull request from a fork."
        When you're ready to get feedback on your pull request, you can mark your draft pull request as ready for
        review. Marking a pull request as ready for review will request reviews from any code owners. You can convert
        a pull request to a draft at any time. For more information, see "Changing the stage of a pull request."
